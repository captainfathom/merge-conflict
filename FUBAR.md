This is Bob's sentence to the group. I have created this sentence to create a merge conflict. The people in this project group are Sean, Ozge, Mark, and Will. We will fix the merge conflict!

This is what Bob & Carol did on Carol's computer when working on the first feature

Ted & Alice's work:

Ted is driving and Alice is navigating
Ted is adding a feature at 1:16pm
Alice is telling Ted to do more stuff 1:17pm
...and after the merge and resulting conflicts, Ted and Alice persist in adding a new feature.

//first iteration of code exchange//

Alice is creating a new feature in the master branch after just resolving a merge conflict created by her careless teammates, Bob and Ted. In this feature, Alice is naively writing with all the confidence in the world thinking that she is making all the cool things in her code.

I am Carol and I started the new feature, but it's not done yet.


I added aditional feature. I am Bob this is my laptop.


Carol(Will) and Bob(Ozge) are working on a new feature on Carol's laptop at 1:46pm.  I <3 features.

Bob adds a feature into round 4. He codes in an function that will bring world peace.

This is Alice's newest feature to the page. This will hopefully create a conflict to fix here in a few minutes.

Ted adds another feature during round two. This feature is the cool ski game that we can't make for project week. Sad face.


Bob is adding a feature on a new branch without doing a git pull origin master beforehand. Bob will rue the day he failed to G-P-O-M.


This is yet another addition to the project by Ted. I like to create merge conflicts because I'm a bad person.

Carol is procuring a merge conflict for the team. She secretly wants to create a problem because she doesn't have enough drama in her life.

Here is more fake code, THIS CODE IS IMPORTANT DO NOT DELETE, IT WILL BREAK EVERYTHING.

This is Alice's laptop we are currently working on very important project.



Ted and Carol's newest addition to the page. It is also important, if you delete it, it will further break your code.
