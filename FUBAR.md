This is Bob's sentence to the group. I have created this sentence to create a merge conflict. The people in this project group are Sean, Ozge, Mark, and Will. We will fix the merge conflict!

This is what Bob & Carol did on Carol's computer when working on the first feature

Ted & Alice's work:

Ted is driving and Alice is navigating
Ted is adding a feature at 1:16pm
Alice is telling Ted to do more stuff 1:17pm
...and after the merge and resulting conflicts, Ted and Alice persist in adding a new feature.

//first iteration of code exchange//

Alice is creating a new feature in the master branch after just resolving a merge conflict created by her careless teammates, Bob and Ted. In this feature, Alice is naively writing with all the confidence in the world thinking that she is making all the cool things in her code.

I am Carol and I started the new feature, but it's not done yet.


Carol(Will) and Bob(Ozge) are working on a new feature on Carol's laptop at 1:46pm.  I <3 features.
