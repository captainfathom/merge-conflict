This is Bob's sentence to the group. I have created this sentence to create a merge conflict. The people in this project group are Sean, Ozge, Mark, and Will. We will fix the merge conflict!

This is what Bob & Carol did on Carol's computer when working on the first feature

Ted & Alice's work:

Ted is driving and Alice is navigating
Ted is adding a feature at 1:16pm
Alice is telling Ted to do more stuff 1:17pm
...and after the merge and resulting conflicts, Ted and Alice persist in adding a new feature.
